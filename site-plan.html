        Patriotic Introduction:
	Congrats, it looks like youre a true patriot (because youre on this website, obviously). Are you dying to get your hands on something that screams patriotism? Are those 5 American flags posted around your house just not cutting it? I present to you Joes Patriotic Emporium, where we sell things that make you say “Hell Yeah Brother”, “Yeehaw”, and “These colors don’t run”. I firmly believe that we're the most patriotic shopping platform out there, so if you like America as much as we do and you want to show it, you came to the right place!

Patriotic Sales Pitch and Description
	Remember, the more American stuff you own, the more patriotic you probably are! Now, there are different flavors of patriotism, so we’ve conveniently divided them up for you into different sections depending on how you would like to display your loyalty to the greatest country on Earth. First is the classic Red, White, and Blue section, where we sell items of the greatest color scheme known to mankind. Second is the Old West section, where we celebrate our nation’s heritage of freedom with items that only true patriots would purchase. Additionally, we have our Jesus Loves You section, where we celebrate our American Christian heritage. Last but certainly not least, we see the Miscellaneous section, dedicated to other unmistakably American things that I didn’t have enough time or energy to categorize.

Patriotic Thank You (and continued sales pitch)
	True patriotism around us is ever-dwindling and it makes me sad, so buy some of these American products for you and your family to remind yourself and them how awesome it is to be an American! Be proud of who you are and the beautiful country you are a part of; remember you’re blessed to be here! Become the patriotic legend you were born to be.

      <h3>Red, White, and Blue</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to Red, White, and Blue! Did you know that not owning an American flag is a sign that you may be a commie-loving scumbag? This is unacceptable; if you would like to remedy this dire situation in your personal life or help a friend who may have this problem, buy one before it’s too late!!

      <h3>Old West</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Old West! If you don’t wear flannels and jeans at least on occasion, can you truly call yourself an American? The answer is no! Pay homage to our great nation’s heritage and buy some for your wardrobe, or risk being unpatriotic! Pro tip: cowboy hats, boots, and leather holsters go well with jeans and flannels.

      <h3>Jesus Loves You</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to Jesus Loves You! He really does love you, by the way. Here we sell all sorts of Bibles and other Jesus-related items to remind you of your faith and how the greatest nation on Earth came to be.

      <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to our Miscellaneous section! The United States of America, as the best place this world has ever seen, has done and made some pretty amazing stuff through the years. It would take forever to categorize, so we just didn’t. Items on this page make wonderful and original gifts for the people you care most about; I’m sure Grandpa Dave’s birthday is coming up pretty soon here, buy him something he’ll actually enjoy, not some crusty cake and some socks (unless those socks are red white and blue of course).
