                    Congrats! It looks like you're a true patriot (because youre on this website, obviously). Are you dying to get your hands on something that screams patriotism? Are those 5 American flags posted around your house just not cutting it? I present to you Joe's Patriotic Emporium, where we sell things that make you say “Hell Yeah Brother”, “Yeehaw”, and “These colors don’t run”. We firmly believe that we're the most patriotic shopping platform out there, so if you like America as much as we do and you want to show it, you came to the right place!

                    Remember, the more American stuff you own, the more patriotic you probably are! Now, there are different flavors of patriotism, so we’ve conveniently divided them up for you into different sections depending on how you would like to display your loyalty to the greatest country on Earth. First is the classic Red, White, and Blue section, where we sell items of the greatest color scheme known to mankind. Second is the Old West section, where we celebrate our nation’s heritage of freedom with items that only true patriots would purchase. Additionally, we have our Jesus Loves You section, where we celebrate our American Christian heritage. Last but certainly not least, we see the Miscellaneous section, dedicated to other unmistakably American things that I didn’t have enough time or energy to categorize.

                    True patriotism around us is ever-dwindling and it makes me sad, so buy some of these American products for you and your family to remind yourself and them how awesome it is to be an American! Be proud of who you are and the beautiful country you are a part of; remember you’re blessed to be here! Become the patriotic legend you were born to be.
